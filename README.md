# PONAM
PONAM- Project on Nodejs + express, Angularjs, MongoDB (basically MEAN but i just want to be cool lmao)

This is my first time developing a web application using the MEAN fullstack. If you don't know what that is, check it out here - http://mean.io/

Sign up, login (passport.js w local strategy) and a broadcast message page that works like twitter. Will probably add more stuff to it in future because who doesn't love JavaScript! ;-)
